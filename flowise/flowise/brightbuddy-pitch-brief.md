## 🙁 What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking a developer partner or collaborator--someone who:
- Believes in creating something meaningful for children
- Can build the app front-to-back OR aid with GIPL/game logic
- Open to profit-sharing, team-based, or light contract model

## 😈 Why It Matters

Children today grow up surrounded by screens, but what if those screens nurtured them back.
BrightBuddy isn't just an app-- it's a companion. A guide. A friend. A light in the dark.
